An application to track flight prices.

The application should:
- Show all the prices for a specific flight route.
- Show flights throught a filter (cheapest, most expensive, soonest)
- Save the search terms/combination of cities. 
  - There should already be a list of cities saved somewhere. (dropdown menu)
- A menu with flights that the user wants to save.
  - WIth a Star or like button next to the flight information.
- Other flight data like department should also be included.
- Choose option for flight in one or two ways.
- Whenever the user checks on the saved flights the application searches for it again and updates the price acordingly.

## Progress

### 20.1.2023
For the retrival of data I am using the BeautifulSoup library and the information I am getting is from 
https://www.kiwi.com. I started the implementation of this but came across some difficulties like scraping just the content I need. 

I probably won't have a working code by midnight but that's what I have the weekend for anyways.
