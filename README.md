An application to track flight prices.

The application should:
- Show all the prices for a specific flight route.
- Show flights throught a filter (cheapest, most expensive, soonest)
- Save the search terms/combination of cities. 
  - There should already be a list of cities saved somewhere. (dropdown menu)
- A menu with flights that the user wants to save.
  - WIth a Star or like button next to the flight information.
- Other flight data like department should also be included.
- Choose option for flight in one or two ways.
- Whenever the user checks on the saved flights the application searches for it again and updates the price acordingly.
